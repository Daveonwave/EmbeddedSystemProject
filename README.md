## Implementation of a display driver for MiosixOS
##### Embedded Systems Project - POLIMI 2020/21

We have developed a driver which extends the MiosixOS environment with the features to support ST7735 display plugged in STM32F4Discovery board with MCU STM32F407VG.

Inside this repository you can find: 
- the PDF file of the project report
- st7735.h and st7735.cpp files which have to be integrated with MiosixOS framework
- a PDF file showing the images we can draw on the display
- a folder containing scripts we worked on during the development
